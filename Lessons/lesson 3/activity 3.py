# 1) Ask the user to enter a word or sentence and store it in `text`.
# 2) Reverse the string stored in `text` and store the reversed result in `revText`.

# (Reversing means the last character becomes first, and the first becomes last.)

# 3) Replace `text` with the reversed string (set `text` equal to `revText`).

# 4) Print a message saying you are showing the reversed string.

# 5) Print the reversed string stored in `text`.

text = input("Enter a string: ")
